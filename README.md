### Summary: Include screenshots or a video of your app highlighting its features
App features simple and clean interface which showcases the list of recipes in a list view with images, Recipe name and Cuisine. Please see screenshots and video under files in repo as well.

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
In this project, I tried to focus on creating a clean but simple user interface which would be able to present the recipes fetched from the given endpoint. Additionally, I also spent time trying to 
understand the best ways to implement concurrency in my project. I chose to prioritize these two areas because I felt it has the most impact for the user experience. 

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
I spent roughly 2-3 hours a day over the period of 4-5 days working on this project. I broke the project down into a few key components. One was to understand the task and scope of the project thoroughly. 
This entailed going through the different asks and expectations of the project. Another was going through each component and seeing what I needed to learn/understand about the component. For example, for 
the file dedicated to calling the APIs, I wanted to ensure I was fetching the data appropriately and using concurrency where I could. If there was a new concept I needed to learn/understand, I would dedicate 
time to do so to make sure I was understanding how and why a variable, method or other piece of code needed to be structured the way it was. 
I also dedicated significant time to debugging. I utilized time to debug any runtime errors by setting up breakpoints in XCode and step through methods in the code to understand any flaws which were occurring. 

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
I had to make a few trade offs for this project for the sake of time. I believe that I had to compromise in depth implementations of the interface. While I have a clean and simple interface which displays the 
necessary information for the project's requirements, if I had more time I wouldâ€™ve implemented more in depth views for the recipes showcasing a video player for youtube videos and such. 

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
I think the weakest part of the project would maybe be some of the error handling. I believe that if I spent more time I could tweak and refine the error handling in various parts of the project to make sure
that I catch/throw exceptions with more specific errors for easier debugging/error comprehension.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
Had fun working on this project :)
